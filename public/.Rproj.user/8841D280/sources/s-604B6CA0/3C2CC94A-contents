#' @description Condition on a vector similar to SQL's between clause

#' @param x A vector.
#' @param low Lower limit
#' @param high Upper Limit
#' @param inclusive If set to \code{TRUE}, then the condition is inclusive of what are set for \code{low} and \code{high}. Other, the "between" is literal.
#' 
#' @return A vector.

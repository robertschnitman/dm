# Introduction

The `dm` package is inspired by the data management functions in other statistical packages such as Stata and SPSS. The purpose of this package is to simplify data management/checking.

# Installation

Currently, this package is only available on Github, so please use `devtools` to install this package.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(devools)) {
  
  install.packages('devtools')
  library(devtools)
  
}

install_github('robertschnitman/dm')
```

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(dm)
```


# Examples

## `recode()`

The `recode()` function is a new way to switch values. You provide three inputs: 

1. A vector,
1. An initial set of values to replace, and 
1. A set of values to replace the initial ones.

```{r}
recode(mtcars$am, 0:1, 2:3)
```

## `numNA()`

[As inspired by Stata](https://www.stata.com/manuals13/m-5missing.pdf), `numNA()` counts the number of missing values in a dataset; `rowNA()` counts the number of missing values by row; and `colNA()` counts the number of missing values by column.

[^1]: 

```{r}
numNA(airquality) # Total number of missing values.
rowNA(airquality) # Number of missing values by row.
colNA(airquality) # Number of missing values by column.
```

## `load_libraries`()

The `load_libraries()` function tests whether a set of libraries has been installed: if not, then it installs and loads them; if already installed, then the function loads the libraries as intended.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
load_libraries(c('tidyverse', 'ggformula', 'abind'))
```
